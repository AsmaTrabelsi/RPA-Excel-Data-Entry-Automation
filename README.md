# RPA Excel Data Entry Automation

This project uses Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to automate data entry tasks that involve entering data from an Excel file into both a web application and a desktop application. The automation process is implemented using UiPath, a popular RPA tool that provides a visual development environment and a wide range of activities and integrations.

<h3>Features</h3>
The project includes the following features:

- Reading data from an Excel file using UiPath's built-in activities for Excel manipulation
- Launching a web browser and navigating to a specific URL using UiPath's web automation capabilities
- Entering data into web forms using UiPath's form-filling activities
- Launching a desktop application and automating data entry tasks using UiPath's desktop automation capabilities
- Handling common error scenarios, such as invalid data or network connectivity issues
- Generating logs and reports to track the automation process and detect any issues that may arise
- 
<h3>Technologies and Tools</h3>
The project uses the following technologies and tools:

- UiPath Studio: the main development environment for creating and testing RPA workflows
- Microsoft Excel: the source of data for the automation process
- Web browser: the target of the web automation tasks (e.g., Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox)
- Desktop application: the target of the desktop automation tasks (e.g., Microsoft Windows application)

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
To run the project on your local machine, you need to have UiPath Studio installed and a valid license key. You also need to have access to the Excel file and the target web and desktop applications.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open UiPath Studio and navigate to the cloned project folder.
